	abstract={This paper presents a problem of computer-aided design of an automatic matching devices controlled in wide frequency band. Method of matching of the complex impedance with a dynamic change in the given frequency band is proposed. A binary control algorithm of the automatic matching of the arbitrary complex loads is presented. A structure of ideal network and quantum and coding of variable network element values are described. Models of the real elements, macroelements and the whole matching device with taken into account of loss and parasitic parameters are presented. Results of computer-aided design and simulation of device characteristics in the given frequency band are represented.},
